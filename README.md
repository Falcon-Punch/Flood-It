# Flood-It
This was the second project during a 2-week crash course on Android 
Programming. I was required to implement the Flood-It game as a mobile
app for Android devices. Flood-It requires the user to tap the screen
starting at the top-left corner. Once a square is touched, all squares
of that same color that are along the outer "edge" will also flood the
open area. The goal is to flood the whole play area with the least amount
of moves possible.
